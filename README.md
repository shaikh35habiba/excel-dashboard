📊 Sales & Profit Dashboard (Excel Mini Project):-
This is my first ever dashboard made in Microsoft Excel. I created it as a mini project for my Data Science course (1st year).
The goal was to understand how sales and profit data can be organized, visualized, and explained using charts and pivot tables.

📌 What I included in this dashboard:-

✔ Total Sales & Total Profit
A small summary section that shows overall sales and profit.

✔ Profit by Year (2023 vs 2024)
A donut chart that compares profit between the two years.

✔ Sales by Month
A line chart that shows how sales changed month by month.
This helped me understand which months performed well and which months were low.

✔ Top 4 Customers
A 3D column chart showing the customers who generated the highest profit:
Abdul Kalam
Ainstin
Modi
Robin

✔ Sales by Product
A product-wise line chart using pivot tables.
It shows which products had higher sales and which ones were low.

✔ Sales by State
A bar chart comparing sales across states like:
California
Florida
Texas
Washington
and more.

✔ Customer Count by Year
Shows how many customers were active in 2023 and 2024.

✔ Extra Monthly Sales Chart
A bar chart that shows sales for each month in descending order.

🛠 How I made it:-
I used:
Excel Pivot Tables
Pivot Charts
Line, bar, column, donut, and 3D charts
Slicers (Year, Category, Month)
Basic data cleaning in Excel
Formatting to make the dashboard look neat and organized
This project helped me practice data cleaning, chart creation, and dashboard layout.

🎯 What I learned from this project:-
How to use pivot tables for summary data
How to build multiple charts from the same dataset
How slicers help make dashboards interactive
How to present business insights in a simple way
How monthly, yearly, product-wise, and state-wise data can show different patterns

👩‍🎓 About Me:-
I am a 1st-year Data Science student, and this is my first attempt at creating a dashboard.
I will continue learning and plan to add:
Power BI dashboards
SQL analysis
Python EDA
More Excel dashboards
This is just the beginning of my portfolio.

⭐ Thank you for viewing my project!

I’m still learning, so any feedback or suggestions are welcome 😊
